### Stages

[Phase 2 Decision Gate 3 (P2)](https://github.com/margo/Margo-collaboration/blob/main/specification_update_processes/process-overview.md#decision-gate-3)

Decision gate 3 is a PR to merge the initial proposal into the `/proposals` folder. The focus is on making sure what the SUP owner plans to propose is clear and aligns to the roadmap. Technical details are not expected at this point.

[Phase 3: Technical Design (P3)](https://github.com/margo/Margo-collaboration/blob/main/specification_update_processes/process-overview.md#phase-3-sup-technical-design)

Phase 3 is when SUP groups work on the technical design. The SUP owner may create a draft PR to merge the SUP into the `/submitted` folder to help get feedback from the community.

[Phase 4: Final (P4)](https://github.com/margo/Margo-collaboration/blob/main/specification_update_processes/process-overview.md#phase-4-final-decision)

Phase 4 is a PR to merge the full proposal to the `/submitted` folder. During this phase community members can post comments on the PR. Once comments have been addressed the SUP will be voted on by the TWG Leads.
