# Specification Update Proposal

## Owner

## Summary

Instead of using Git to transport the desired state to the device, a REST API is used - namely, a well-established, well-defined, and widely-used API for digital artifact distribution and management.
This API is particularly easy to implement thanks to its simplicity, making it accessible for devices with varying capabilities.
The details on that API can be found in the section [Technical proposal](#technical-proposal).

This approach offers the significant benefit of leveraging available registries and client libraries.
There are multiple open-source software implementations of both registries and client libraries that are battle-tested and widely used across the industry, eliminating the need to develop and maintain custom solutions.

## Reason for proposal

The [specification currently indicates Git](https://specification.margo.org/fleet-management/workload/workload-deployment/) is used for this process, but the **Margo TWG members voted against using Git** because of the following:

1. Git is an industry standard, but not a specification, so there is no way to implement compliance testing based on Git.
   It also means the Git implementation could change at any point.
   This proposal addresses this concern by using a well-defined specification with clear compliance requirements.
1. Since Git was not based on a specification, the members felt we were dictating an implementation.
   This proposal addresses this concern by referencing an established specification.
   Vendors have the freedom to choose whichever implementation approach they wish to comply with the Margo specification.
1. There were concerns over the amount of additional storage space a git repository requires on the device.
   While this can be alleviated with shallow checkouts, using an artifact-based approach for the desired state doesn't include the complete history like a Git repository does.
1. There were concerns over the overhead of requiring a git client on the device.
   With this proposal, requests are all HTTP(s) requests and can be made using standard HTTP(s) clients/libraries.
1. There were concerns over the chattiness between the Git client and the server.
   By controlling the contents of the blob, we have some control over how chatty the API calls will be.
   We will need to keep this in mind as we work on the technical details for this proposal.

It is therefore out of the scope of this proposal arguing why a REST API instead of Git.

This Specification Update Proposal (SUP) relates to parts of [feature 100](https://github.com/margo/specification/issues/100) and [feature 101](https://github.com/margo/specification/issues/101), which addresses the need to define the desired state artifact(s) that are produced via the WFM, and retrieved via the edge client, to enable state seeking management of workloads at the edge.

The REST API being proposed (detailed in the section [Technical proposal](#technical-proposal)) have multiple different implementations, many of them open source software (OSS).
Additionally, the required infrastructure is frequently available and is being used for software distribution (e.g. for container images).

## Requirements alignment acknowledgement

This proposal addresses parts of [feature 100](https://github.com/margo/specification/issues/100) and [feature 101](https://github.com/margo/specification/issues/101).

The following is in scope for this proposal:

1. Packaging and distributing the desired state documents
1. Using the APIs defined in the [REST-API Specification](#rest-api-specification) section for pulling the desired state to the device
1. Securing the authenticity and integrity of the individual desired state documents (via signatures)

The following is not in scope for this proposal:

1. Defining how the device receives the location and authentication information on where the desired state documents are available
1. Defining how a device is notified when the desired state documents are updated beyond using the "latest" tag
1. Ensuring that only specific versions of valid (authenticity and integrity) desired state documents can be installed to avoid downgrade attacks (this is a consequence of the previous point)

## Technical proposal

Getting an edge device to execute one or more workloads implies:

1. Obtaining the desired state, which describes the workload(s) that should be executed.
2. Getting any resources required by the workloads (e.g,. a container image).
3. Executing the workload.

This proposal only deals with the first step for obtaining the desired state.
It is important to notice, though, that hereby proposed REST API can also be used to distribute resources required by the workloads, which is one of the motivations for this proposal.

It is important to remember that the decision to use a REST API instead of Git to distribute the desired state was **voted by the Margo TWG members**.

This proposal is a pull-approach to distribute the desired state documents to the edge devices.
It is based on signaling (notification from the backend, schedule for polling,...) the edge device to check if a new desired state is available in the backend.

The following components and concepts are relevant to achieving the desired state of one or more applications on an edge device:

1. A signal for the edge device to check the availability of new desired state document(s).
   Check the section [Signal: Check Desired State](#signal-check-desired-state) for more details on this.
2. The format an protocol to distribute the desired state documents.
   This includes the REST API and the "packaging" of those documents, which is the scope of this SUP.
   Check the section [Fetch Desired State: REST API](#fetch-desired-state-rest-api) for more details on this.

All this proposal assumes that desired state documents are signed to ensure the authenticity and integrity of those documents as mentioned above.
There are a couple of mechanisms to sign OCI artifacts (like Cosign and Notary v2) which are open source software (OSS) and battle-proofed.
But any alternative signing mechanism is also acceptable.

### REST-API specification

The hereby proposed "well-established REST API" is that of the [OCI Distribution v1.1 specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md).

As mentioned before, there are multiple implementations of this API (both servers and clients), many of them open source software (OSS).
It has as a consequence the benefit of allowing available OCI registries and client libraries to be used, as well as allowing Workload Fleet Manager suppliers to option to implement their backend solution without requiring the use of an OCI registry.

Additionally, [API-conformance tests](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/main/conformance) are available to validate any implementation.

### Protocol support

The REST API implementation supports HTTP 1.1, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of client libraries and network infrastructures.
This support is particularly important as many target networks, especially in industrial and legacy environments, only support HTTP up to version 1.1.
By maintaining compatibility with HTTP 1.1, the solution ensures deployability across restricted network environments where newer HTTP protocol versions may not be available or allowed through firewalls and proxies.

### Signal: Check desired state

As mentioned before, signaling devices that new desired state documents are available and which they are is out of the scope of this proposal.

Therefore any mechanisms providing protection against following attacks (among others) is part of the signaling and therefore out the scope of this SUP:

1. Indefinite freeze attacks (freshness guarantee)
2. Fast-forward attacks
3. Endless data attacks

Protection against another very common attack like the rollback/replay attack can be accomplished with the mechanisms within the scope of this SUP.
The metadata of the desired state documents should provide either only increasing version numbers or timestamps.
That way the device can simply reject any desired state document with older or lower versioned metadata.

But since those solutions should cover some aspects relevant for different security-related aspects, we are going to sketch some of them in this section.
Protecting against the above mentioned attacks is security-relevant and therefore the sketched approaches try to rely on battle-proofed mechanisms and software.

Basically there are two different approaches:

1. Polling (pull approach): the edge device regularly checks the availability of a new desired state.
2. Notifications (push approach): the edge device gets notified somehow from the backend that a new desired state is available.

#### Polling

In the case of polling, no information about the latest desired state version is available on the device.
This information must be obtained by the device externally in a trustworthy way.
Please notice that in the case of [Notifications](#notifications) this information is provided with the object signaling the availability of a new desired state.

Ideally the information of the latest desired state version is obtained from a server providing an OCI-compatible REST-API so that no additional services or protocols are needed.
Potentially even the same one providing the desired state documents.

These are possible ways to make the currently (latest) desired state version know to the device:

1. "Latest" tag provided by the REST-API returns the digest which unambiguously identifies the desired state document to be pulled.
   No defense against the above mentioned attacks is provided.
2. An implementation of the [TUF (The Update Framework)](https://theupdateframework.io) is used to provide the digest which unambiguously identifies the desired state document to be pulled.
   The different guarantees provided by TUF against the above mentioned attacks combined with the use of digests and increasing version numbers or timestamps with the desired state documents provide a best of the class security, but increases the complexity a bit.

#### Notifications

In the case of notifications, there are mechanisms are capable of providing information about the latest desired state version in a trustworthy way.

Notifications must be secure so that the information on which desired state documents are requested to be fetch can be trusted.
That way any properly signed desired state document is trustworthy.

Different potential notification mechanisms are thinkable:

1. [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) is the simplest approach, since it only requires HTTP 1.1, what is required anyway for the REST API.
2. Message bus (like MQTT), which requires specialized brokers, clients,...

### Fetch desired state: REST API

As mentioned above, the core of the proposal is a REST API compatible with the OCI distribution API.
It is a secondary goal of this SUP enabling the use of available OCI registries and clients(e.g., ORAS, FluxCD, ArgoCD), if desired.

However, the option remains open for implementing a custom solution using a simple and well-defined API, so using an OCI registry is not mandatory.

The following aspects are to be considered when fetching the desired state concerning security:

#### Authentication and authorization

Authentication and authorization of the devices fetching the desired state documents are not in scope for this proposal.

The [Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) does not address authentication and authorization.

OCI registries implement the [Docker Registry v2 protocol](https://docker-docs.uclv.cu/registry/spec/api/), which uses [RFC 7235](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7235) to define the WWW-Authenticate header to indicate which authentication schemes are supported.
Most OCI registries support at a minimum [Basic](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7617) and [Bearer Token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) schemes for authentication.

#### Tampering attacks

The mechanism to use for desired state document signing is outside of the scope of this proposal.
But this proposal enables the integration of existing mechanisms and tools (like Cosign or Notary v2) that provide it out of the box.

The expectation is that other future proposals will address how these are handled to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the desired state artifacts.

#### Rollback attacks

If whatever valid desired state being provided is considered the current, latest or desired one, there is a chance for a rollback (AKA [Downgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack)) attack in which an old desired state with vulnerabilities is "rolled back" (by a malicious attacker or mistakenly).

As mentioned above, the use of only increasing version numbers or timestamps in the metadata associated to the desired state documents with the OCI manifests protects against it.

> **MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED**: Need some more details here.
> I proposed adding an attribute to the manifest to indicate the minimum acceptable version of the desired state.
> This would allow the Device to reject any desired state blob with a version older than what is already applied on the device.
> This would require the Workload Fleet Manager and device to keep track of the version of the last created and applied desired state blob.

            oci->>wmc: desired state
        end
    end
```

### Management client requests

It MUST be possible for the device to pull the manifest and blob using the behavior defined in the [Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) for the following endpoints.

|  |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| GET/HEAD | /v2/\<name\>/manifests/\<reference\>| Used to pull the manifest describing the device's desired state|
| GET/HEAD | /v2/\<name\>/blobs/\<digests\>| Used to pull the blob containing the device's desired state|

The routes provided to the device by the Workload Fleet Manager do not have to match the routes defined in the Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification (e.g., workload fleet manager is using an API-Gateway to expose the registry) but the behavior of the endpoint MUST match with regard to the request headers, parameters, and payload,d and response headers and payloads

> **MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED:** The original proposal had endpoints defined with the expectation that an API-Gateway would be used.
> I feel it's more flexible if we expect the WFM to provide the URLs they want, so they have the option of using API Gateway, pointing directly to an existing OCI registry, or pointing to their custom web service implementation.

How this information is provided is outside the scope of this proposal, but the expectation is that the Workload Fleet Manager provides it during onboarding.

#### Manifest request

The Workload Fleet Manager MUST provide the manifest URL that the device must call to obtain the manifest.
The API is expected to behave as defined in the [Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) for the `GET /v2/\<name\>/manifests/\<reference\>` endpoint.
When the Workload Fleet Manager provides the manifest URL, it also provides the `reference` (aka tag) to use for the request.

##### Response

> **MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED**: The original proposal suggested sending a single ApplicationDeployment.yaml in the desired state blob so each workload would have its own desired state manifest.
> This approach doesn't address the concerns around having a chatty API that were raised around using Git.
> Also, this makes it more difficult to get a picture of the whole desired state the device should have.
> As an alternative, we suggested following the declarative approach, and instead of sending a single ApplicationDeployment.yaml, it would instead send the entire desired state for all workloads in the blob so the device can ensure everything matches.

The response from the endpoint provides the desired state manifest JSON document defined by the [OCI Image Manifest Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.1/manifest.md) containing the information about the configuration, layers, and annotations for the desired state blob.

The manifest file MUST be created as defined by the OIC Image Manifest Specification with the following additional requirements:

- The Media Type for the manifest MUST be `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`
- The Artifact Type MUST be `application/vnd.org.margo.config.v1+json`
- The manifest MUST contain a single layer containing configuration for the desired state TAR GZIP file
- The Media Type for the desired state TAR GZIP file layer MUST be `application/vnd.org.margo.manifests.layer.v1+tar+gzip`

##### Response payload

> **DISCUSSION NEEDED**: This probably isn't the proper manifest, so we'll need to work through the details.

```JSON
{
    "schemaVersion": "2",

        }
    ]
}
```

| Property | Required | Data Type | Description |

The value MUST comply with the [OCI Image v1.1 digest specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/descriptor.md#digests). It is a hash of the bytes of the desired state TAR GZIP file, which can be used to verify the integrity of the data. |
| layers[].size | Y | integer | The size of the desired state TAR GZIP file. It can be used as a loose way to verify data integrity; the digest is a much better option for integrity verification. |

#### Blob request

The Workload Fleet Manager MUST provide the blob URL that the device MUST call to obtain the desired state blob.
The API is expected to behave as defined in the [Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) for the `GET /v2/\<name\>/blobs/\<digests\>` endpoint.
The digest to use for the call is retrieved from the manifest response payload.

##### Request payload

None

##### Response description

The response from the endpoint provides a TAR GZIP file containing the [Margo Desired State specification](https://specification.margo.org/margo-api-reference/workload-api/desired-state-api/desired-state/) YAML files for all workloads that should be deployed on the device.

The TAR file MUST only contain the individual desired state YAML files, in plain text, for each workload expected to be deployed on the device.
There are no requirements for how the individual YAML files are organized within the TAR file.

The following rules MUST be followed by the device when applying the latest desired state:

- If the workload's desired state YAML file was not in the previous desired state blob, the device MUST attempt to install the new workload
- If the workload's desired state YAML file was in the previous desired state blob, but has changes, the device MUST attempt to update the existing workload
- If the workload's desired state YAML file was in the previous desired state blob, but has NOT changed, the device is not required to do anything for the existing workload
- If the workload's desired state YAML file was in the previous desired state blob, but not in the latest desired state blob, the device MUST attempt to remove the existing workload.
